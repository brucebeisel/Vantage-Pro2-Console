    "LPS <loop packet type bit mask-hex> <number of packets to send-decimal>"
                Sends the specified number of the different loop packet(s), 1 every 2 seconds. Console sleeps between packets.
    "HILOWS"    Sends all the current high/low data in a single 436 byte data block, plus 2 CRC bytes.
    "PUTRAIN <Yearly Rain in rain clicks-decimal>"
                Set the Yearly rainfall amount on the Vantage Console.
    "PUTET <Yearly ET in 100th inch-decimal>"

4. EEPROM Commands
    "GETEE"     Reads the full 4K EEPROM in one data block.
    "EEWR <EE address-hex> <EE data-hex>"
                Writes one byte of data to the specified address in the EEPROM.
    "EERD <EE address-hex> <number of bytes to read-hex>"
                Reads the specified number of bytes starting at the specified address. Results are given as hex strings, one byte per line.
