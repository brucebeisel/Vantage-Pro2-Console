The deployment of the Vantage Pro2 Console is fairly simple. It only requires a few executables
and scripts as well as the creation of a few run-time directories.

<install dir>/bin
<install dir>/log
<install dir>/archive

/etc/init.d/weathersense
/etc/rc.5/S99weathersense -> /etc/init.d/weathersense
/etc/rc.5/K01weathersense -> /etc/init.d/weathersense
