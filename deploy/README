The deployment of the Vantage Pro2 Console is fairly simple. It only requires a few executables
and scripts as well as the creation of a few run-time directories.
There are a few prerequisites for this installation:
    1. The user "weathersense" must exist
    2. The directory /weathersense must exist
    3. Node version 18 or newer must be installed

/weathersense/<version>/bin
/weathersense/<version>/log
/weathersense/<version>/archive
/weathersense/<version>/node

/etc/init.d/weathersense
/etc/rc.5/S99weathersense -> /etc/init.d/weathersense
/etc/rc.5/K01weathersense -> /etc/init.d/weathersense
